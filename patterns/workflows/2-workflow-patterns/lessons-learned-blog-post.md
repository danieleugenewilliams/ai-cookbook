# Pitfalls to Avoid

When implementing a project, several pitfalls can derail progress, slow down development, or lead to significant late-stage issues. Here, I outline common challenges we faced during our project, how we resolved them, and what lessons we learned for future projects.

1. **Test Coverage Gaps:** In the early stages, we discovered that certain features, such as rate limiting and newsletter functionality, lacked comprehensive test coverage. As a result, bugs emerged late in the development process, hindering deployment timelines. To combat this, we established a policy enforcing minimum test coverage thresholds across the project. This proactive approach ensured that every new feature would meet defined coverage criteria before merging into the main branch.

2. **API Mocking Issues:** Initially, our automated tests for API routes encountered failures due to incomplete mocks. This created a frustrating cycle of debugging that consumed time. The solution was to enhance our test helpers to better mimic the API's real-world behavior and closely align our mocks with the expected request and response structures. Through better mock configuration, our testing process became more reliable, ensuring that changes could be validated without the risk of unexpected breaks due to testing errors.

3. **Assumptions About Integrations:** We underestimated the complexity of integrating with services like HubSpot and Substack. Initially, we assumed these integrations would be straightforward. However, they required unexpected custom logic. To avoid this pitfall in the future, we decided to prototype any third-party integrations early in the development process and meticulously document API limitations every time we worked with external services.

4. **Manual Content Migration:** Confusion and delays arose from unclear responsibilities related to PDF uploads and the content migration process. This lack of clarity not only slowed down progress but also exacerbated team frustrations. In response, we created clear checklists and appointed specific team members to each content migration task. This approach ensured accountability and a systematic process that greatly improved efficiency.

5. **Dependency Warnings:** Encountering numerous warnings due to outdated testing libraries led to unexpected setbacks in the testing workflow. This forced us to implement regular dependency audits to identify and resolve issues as they arose. Consistent auditing practices not only maintained the health of our codebase but also eliminated redundant distractions during development sprints.

6. **Documentation Drift:** As the project progressed, our documentation became outdated and inconsistent, leading to confusion among team members and the AI agent. We established regular documentation reviews aligned with project milestones, ensuring that our documentation would remain a reliable single source of truth throughout the project lifecycle.

7. **Context Loss in LLMs:** Using large language models (LLMs) such as GPT posed challenges, particularly regarding context loss when token limits were reached. This issue highlighted the importance of maintaining up-to-date, modular documentation. We implemented a persistent `agent-work.md` file to track current tasks and ensure information was always at hand for both AI and team members. This practice greatly reduced miscommunication and rework, making it easier for human and AI collaborators to remain aligned on project objectives.

These lessons not only helped us overcome specific challenges but also established a robust framework for future projects. By staying vigilant for these common pitfalls and implementing concrete solutions, we can ensure smoother project implementations going forward.
